# üëã Welcome to Salama Mama!

## About Salama Mama
Salama Mama is an innovative digital platform designed to assist new mothers dealing with postpartum depression (PPD) using artificial intelligence technology. This intelligent application offers soothing conversations, relevant insights, and customized resources according to each user's unique situation and requirements. With a focus on Goal 3: Good Health & Well-being, Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities, and Goal 4: Quality Education as part of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, Salama Mama strives to make a lasting positive impact on users and their communities. The app serves as a secure haven for new mothers seeking assistance with their mental health during the critical postpartum phase by offering personalized data and aid, thereby promoting self-efficacy and resiliency amidst challenges.

## Inspiration
Our team identified the significant challenge faced by many women struggling with postpartum depression, especially among underrepresented communities lacking adequate mental health care resources. Expensive treatments and therapies often hinder these individuals from obtaining essential support during such vulnerable times. Recognizing the potential impact of combining our expertise and innovative minds, we resolved to develop creative solutions capable of providing global assistance to women dealing with postpartum depression. Ultimately, our goal is aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3‚ÄîGood Health and Well-being and SDG 10‚ÄîReduced Inequalities, aiming to bridge gaps and empower underserved populations worldwide and Reducing Inequalities for marginalized populations suffering from postpartum depression.
